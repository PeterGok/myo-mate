MyoMote - Myo-controlled universal remote
=========================================

This hack acts as a universal infrared remote as it can record and emit any infrared signal it wants. In order to make the remote easy to use, it is controlled by the Thalmic Myo. The Myo is connected to an android phone that can be kept in the user's pocket and the signal is relayed to the arduino via bluetooth. The arduino then finally emits the signal.

Here is a video of the device in action:
